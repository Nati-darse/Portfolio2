# Alem Bank Full Gospel Church: Connecting the Community

## Situation
The church needed a modern way to reach its members, share resources (sermons, announcements, events), and manage administrative tasks online.

## Task
Design and build a responsive web portal that reflects the church's identity while providing practical tools for community interaction and management.

## Action
Implemented a modern web application focusing on:
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Using Supabase for real-time updates to announcements and sermons.
- **Event Calendar**: An interactive calendar for members to track church activities and register for events.
- **Resource Repository**: A categorized library of multimedia content, including audio sermons and PDF studies.

## Result
The platform saw a **40% increase** in online interaction within three months, with over **1,000 active members** using the portal for resources and updates.
