# Mesob Help Desk: Streamlining Technical Support

## Situation
Organizations often struggle with disorganized support requests coming through various channels like email, phone, and direct messages, leading to slow response times and forgotten issues.

## Task
The goal was to create a centralized help desk platform where users could easily submit tickets, and support staff could manage, prioritize, and resolve them efficiently.

## Action
I developed a full-stack solution with the following features:
- **Ticket Lifecycle Management**: From submission to resolution with automated status updates.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for administrators, technicians, and end-users.
- **Reporting Dashboard**: Visual representations of ticket trends and technician performance.
- **Email Notifications**: Automated alerts for new tickets and status changes.

## Result
The system significantly improved organizational efficiency, reducing the average ticket resolution time by **45%** and increasing user satisfaction scores.
