# UN-ET UOG Chapter: Digital Hub for Student Leadership

## Situation
The university chapter needed a way to formally represent itself online, manage student memberships, and share news and opportunities with its large member base.

## Task
Develop a lightweight but robust portal that could handle high traffic during registration periods and serve as a reliable source of information.

## Action
Built using React and Firebase for high availability:
- **Membership Portal**: Streamlined student registration and profile management.
- **News Feed**: Real-time updates on chapter activities and organizational news.
- **Resource Hub**: Sharing documents and educational materials relevant to the chapter's mission.

## Result
The portal reached **2,000 active users** and manages a consistent monthly traffic of **5,000 visits**, providing a centralized platform for student leadership and engagement.
