# Warka Academy: Impactful Technical Education

## Situation
Technical education in specialized fields was often inaccessible due to high costs or lack of specialized regional platforms. There was a demand for a high-performance Learning Management System (LMS) tailored to local needs.

## Task
Develop a modern, accessible LMS that offered a premium learning experience, including progress tracking, interactive quizzes, and seamless video streaming for students across varied connectivity environments.

## Action
Using **Next.js** and **Supabase**, I implemented:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Leveraged SSR for course pages to ensure fast initial loads and SEO optimization.
- **Supabase Auth & Realtime**: Integrated secure authentication and real-time progress syncing across devices.
- **Adaptive Video UI**: Built a custom video player that handled varying connection speeds gracefully to minimize buffering for students.

## Result
Since launch, over **2,000 students** have enrolled in **50+ specialized courses**. The platform maintains high engagement rates due to its performance-first design and intuitive learning paths.

```typescript
// Progress Tracking Sync
async function syncProgress(userId: string, lessonId: string) {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('student_progress')
    .upsert({ user_id: userId, lesson_id: lessonId, completed: true });
  
  if (error) throw new Error('Failed to sync progress');
}
```
