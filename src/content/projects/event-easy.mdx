# Event Easy: Real-time Ticketing Ecosystem

## Situation
In a rapidly growing digital economy, event organizers in East Africa faced significant challenges with manual ticketing, fraud, and lack of real-time attendee data. Existing solutions were either too expensive or lacked the local payment integrations needed.

## Task
The objective was to build a secure, scalable, and intuitive platform that could handle thousands of concurrent transactions during high-demand event launches while providing organizers with a "command center" for their data.

## Action
I engineered the platform using **Next.js 15** and **PostgreSQL**. Key technical implementations included:
- **Optimistic UI**: Implemented real-time seat selection using WebSockets and optimistic updates to ensure a lag-free experience.
- **Queue Management**: Developed a custom request queue for ticket purchases to prevent database bottleneck during peak traffic.
- **Local Integrations**: Built adapters for diverse payment gateways used in the region.

## Result
The platform successfully processed over **10,000 tickets** in its first month with zero downtime. It achieved a **98/100 Lighthouse performance score** and reduced attendee check-in time by **60%** through QR-code based automated systems.

```tsx
// Example of the Optimistic Check-in Logic
const handleCheckIn = async (ticketId: string) => {
  setCheckins(prev => [...prev, ticketId]); // Optimistic
  try {
    await api.checkIn(ticketId);
  } catch (err) {
    setCheckins(prev => prev.filter(id => id !== ticketId)); // Rollback
  }
}
```
