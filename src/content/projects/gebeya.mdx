# Gebeya: Orchestrating a Digital Marketplace

## Situation
Local merchants lacked a centralized platform to reach a wider audience, while consumers struggled with fragmented e-commerce options. There was a need for a robust, multi-vendor system that could manage diverse inventory and complex order flows.

## Task
The goal was to architect a full-stack marketplace that provided unified search and discovery for users, while giving vendors a powerful administrative suite to manage products, sales, and analytics.

## Action
I developed the system using the **MERN** stack. Key contributions included:
- **Unified Schema Design**: Designed a flexible MongoDB schema to handle varied product types from different categories.
- **Vendor Dashboard**: Built a comprehensive React-based admin panel for vendors with real-time sales charts and inventory management.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Implemented an efficient server-side filtering and pagination system to handle thousands of items with low latency.

## Result
The platform scaled to support over **500 vendors** and served **25,000+ active users**. It became a key player in the local digital commerce space, facilitating thousands of transactions monthly with a focus on ease-of-use for non-technical merchants.

```javascript
// Vendor Sales Analytics Aggregation
const getVendorStats = async (vendorId) => {
  return await Order.aggregate([
    { $match: { "items.vendor": vendorId } },
    { $group: { _id: null, totalSales: { $sum: "$totalAmount" } } }
  ]);
}
```
